=======
The original xdelta will generate a smash rom that is compatible with our ASM code. Much of our edits are done within
the compressed files within the rom. If you utilize a vanilla Smash 64 rom, it will not work correctly.

You must utilize the xdelta patch to generate a good rom for Assembly.

You must place your legally acquired patched ROM in the rom folder for this to work. It must be named original.z64
