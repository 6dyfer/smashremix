The Smash Remix xdelta will generate the current version of the Ganondorf mod of Smash 64. No further patch is necessary. For those uninterested in the messing around with the source code, this is all you will need. Use the xdelta UI and put your legally acquired rom in the original box and the xdelta in the patch box. You will then have the Smash Remix/Ganondorf Mod.

The original xdelta will generate a smash rom that is compatible with my ASM code. Much of my edits are done within
the compressed data within the rom. If you try to utilize a vanilla Smash 64 rom, it will not work correctly.

You must utilize my xdelta patch to generate a good rom for Assembly.

You must then place your legally acquired ROM in the roms folder for this to work. It must be named original.z64

The model data is located within gnd.bin in the src folder.

armor generates a suped up version of Yoshi's Armor when Ganondorf does a Warlock Punch.

slowattack changes the attack speeds of Ganondorf's attacks.

gnd.obj and gnd.mtl are the current model and materials used for Ganondorf (these are not utilized in the Assembly and are placed here for reference).
