The Smash Remix xdelta will generate the current version of the Ganondorf mod of Smash 64. No further patch would
be necessary.

The original xdelta will generate a smash rom that is compatible with my ASM code. Much of my edits are done within
the compressed data within the rom. If you utilize a vanilla Smash 64 rom, it will not work correctly.

You must utilize my xdelta patch to generate a good rom for Assembly.

You must place your legally acquired ROM in the rom folder for this to work. It must be named original.z64

The model data is located within gnd.bin in the src folder.

armor generates suped up version of Yoshi Armor when Ganondorf does a Warlock Punch.

slowattack changes the attack speeds of Ganondorf's attacks.
